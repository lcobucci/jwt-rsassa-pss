# E2E test token

These token1_PS*.txt files have been created using https://jwt.io

Use the token1.private.key file for signing the token.

Data is a very simple `{"foo":"bar"}`, and the header only is `{"alg":"PSxxx"}`.

This test case is about being able to validate the tokens, not about generating them.
